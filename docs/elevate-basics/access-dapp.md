# Access dApp

The Elevate Labs Lending Protocol is a new peer-to-peer lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend across blockchains. It features a simple design with powerful features like trustless operations, stable loans with fixed interest rates and terms, global network accessibility, and scalability for loans of any size. The protocol operates on smart contracts and blockchain technology, ensuring permissionless and transparent transactions. Users can lend by specifying loan parameters and borrowers can review and accept these proposals. The platform is currently deployed on a testnet and accessible worldwide.
