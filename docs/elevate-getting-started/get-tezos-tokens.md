## Get Tezos Tokens on Ghostnet

Welcome to the "Get Tezos Tokens on Ghostnet" guide! This page will walk you through the steps to obtain Tezos tokens on the Ghostnet test network, a crucial step for testing and development purposes on the Elevate Labs platform.

### Step 1: Understanding Ghostnet
- Ghostnet is a test network (testnet) for the Tezos blockchain.
- It allows developers and users to test Tezos applications without using real tokens.

### Step 2: Connecting to a Tezos Faucet
- A faucet is a service that dispenses free test tokens for use on testnets.
- To use a Tezos faucet, you'll need a Tezos wallet address from the Ghostnet.

### Step 3: Obtaining a Tezos Wallet
- If you don't have a Tezos wallet, create one that is compatible with Ghostnet.
- Ensure that your wallet is set to operate on the Ghostnet testnet.

### Step 4: Visiting the Tezos Faucet
- Go to an official Tezos faucet website for Ghostnet, see [https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/](https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/).
- Follow the instructions to request Tezos tokens.
- You will typically need to enter your wallet address and complete a captcha verification.

### Step 5: Receiving Tokens
- Once you submit your request, the faucet will send a small amount of Tezos tokens to your wallet.
- It may take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet.

### Step 6: Verifying the Transaction
- Check your wallet to confirm the receipt of the tokens.
- These tokens are for testing purposes only and have no real-world value.

### Tips for Using Tezos on Ghostnet
- Use these tokens to test smart contracts and transactions on the Elevate Labs platform.
- Remember, since Ghostnet is a test network, the tokens and transactions are not real and do not carry any monetary value.
